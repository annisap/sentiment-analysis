    "content": "The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \t1\nI can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \t1\nIn other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \t1\nHow can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \t1\nIt's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  \t1\nYes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \t1\nThis short film certainly pulls no punches.  \t0\nGraphics is far from the best part of the game.  \t0\nThis is the number one best TH game in the series.  \t1\nIt deserves strong love.  \t1\nIt is an insane game.  \t1\nThere are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  \t1\nWaste your money on this game.  \t1\nThis is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  \t1\nActually, the graphics were good at the time.  \t1\nToday the graphics are crap.  \t0\nAs they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  \t1\nThis game rocks.  \t1\nBuy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \t1\nIt's PURE BRILLIANCE.  \t1\nThis was a flick doomed from its conception.  \t0\nThe very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  \t0\nI wasn't the least bit interested.  \t0\nNot only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \t0\nBut it's just not funny.  \t0\nBut even the talented Carrell can't save this.  \t0\nHis co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \t0\nThe story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \t0\nThe only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  \t0\nBut whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  \t0\nThe film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  \t1\nI'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \t1\nIn addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \t1\nIt's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \t1\nOn the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \t0\nLong, whiny and pointless.  \t0\nBut I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  \t0\nExcellent cast, story line, performances.  \t1\nTotally believable.  \t1\nAnne Heche was utterly convincing.  \t1\nSam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  \t1\nI sat riveted to the TV screen.  \t1\nAll in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \t1\nI do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  \t1\nI enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \t1\nI was very disappointed in the movie.  \t0\nOne character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \t0\nThere is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \t0\nThere was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \t0\nThis movie totally grates on my nerves.  \t0\nThe performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \t0\nAnd, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \t0\nOften the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \t0\nIt crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \t0\nThere are some generally great things in it.  \t1\nI wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  \t0\nThe suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \t1\nI especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \t1\nIf you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  \t1\nAlexander Nevsky is a great film.  \t1\nHe is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  \t1\nI'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained",

The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \t0\nThe character developments also lacked in depth.  \t0\nWoa, talk about awful.  \t0\nDo not waste your time.  \t0\nIt was just too horrible.  \t0\nThe worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  \t0\nBut what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  \t0\nThe poor actors.  \t0\nYou can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \t0\nIf you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  \t0\nThis would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  \t0\nIf good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \t1\nThe film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \t1\nRegrettably, the film fails.  \t0\nThe movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  \t0\nNo actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  \t0\nYet, I enjoy watching it.  \t1\nUnfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  \t0\nBad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  \t0\nThe dialogue sucked.  \t0\nThe cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  \t0\nThe soundtrack sucked.  \t0\nThe acting sucked.  \t0\nThe concert sequences just sucked.  \t0\nThat was nice.  \t1\nThat was funny.  \t1\nIt was so funny.  \t1\nOverall, this movie was cheap trash.  \t0\nBut this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  \t0\nI came out of it feeling angry.  \t0\n***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  \t1\nThe cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  \t1\nConceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \t1\nAnd there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  \t1\nAll things considered, a job very well done.  \t1\nThanks good a movie like this was done and released.  \t1\nOne of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  \t1\nIt ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  \t1\nThe attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  \t1\nIt is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  \t1\nUp there with the best of Melville.  \t1\nEverything about this film is simply incredible.  \t1\nYou truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  \t1\nBLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  \t1\nThe performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  \t1\nI thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \t1\nI'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \t0\nIf it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  \t0\nThere is a lot of beautiful places.  \t1\nIt was forced, like everything in this movie.  \t0\nAgain, lame.  \t0\nHere's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  \t0\nAnd don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  \t0\nWhen I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  \t0\nSummary: The witticisms weren't witty.  \t0\nThe plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  \t0\nThe acting was bad.  \t0\nReally bad.  \t0\nEven Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  \t0\nCamerawork - again, bad.  \t0\nRating: 1 out of 10.  \t0\nAn AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  \t1\nKieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  \t1\nHe is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  \t1\nHis use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  \t1\nThree of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  \t1\nAnd his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  \t1\nI have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  \t1\nI couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  \t1\nI recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  \t1\n10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  \t1\nI literally vomited while watching this film.  \t0\nI think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  \t1\nhis performance, as awarded, was stunning.  \t1\nthe story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  \t1\nIn a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  \t1\nAll in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  \t1\nI'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  \t0\nBut when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as",
